Turtle strategy overview -

this will be a strategy that we can use on the 1minute, 5min, 15, 1 hour and 4 hour.. 
we will set a variable for timeframe so we can easily change the timeframe.

the short will be exact inverse of the long explained below

when a 55 bar High is cracked and price is moving up, enter long by making a 
limit order at the bid price (post only so we dont market on accident).

when a 55 bar short cracked and price moving down, enter short.
since this should work on the above timeframes, the 55 bar depends on the timeframe.. 
ex. 55 1min bars is 55 minutes, and 55 1 hour bars is 55 hours.

this will only run between 930est and 4pm est m-f and exit before 4pm each friday if we are 
still in a position and havent had the exit parameters below hit.

EXIT for Profit - when we make a profit of .2% (make this a changeable variable)

STOP LOSS - at 2 x ATR (we will call this 2n) find the ATR (average true range) 
and multiply it by 2. and if price drops 2n from our entry price, close the position
