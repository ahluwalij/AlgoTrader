consolidation_pop

as always, this will be long and short. i will explain the long case and we will 
just create the opposite for the short entries. essentially, we want to build a 
strategy that looks for consolidation (price moving sideways for a bit) on short 
time frames (1m, 3m, 5, 15, 1h) and it will buy the lows of that range with the 
expectation that it will Pop through the resistance at some point. 

most traders will be shorting the resistance, and we will be doing the opposite, 
longing the lows of the consolidation near resistance for a quick profit with 
the thought that price will atleast briefly crack resistance. 

the bid to buy in the lower 1/3rd of the consolidation and take profit 
at .3% and stop loss at .25%.

how long of consolidation are we looking for? please make this a variable and 
we can use 10 bars for now
