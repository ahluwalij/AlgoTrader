correlation algo

we will use coinbase pro api to pull in prices for ethereum on the X minute chart 
(1m, 3 min, 5min, 15m) we will use coinbase cause their prices are quicker to update, 
there is a bit of lag when phemex OHLC data but the bid and ask data is fine

when ethereum makes a move outside of the True range in the past Y bars (20 to start) 
or outside of support and resistance of that time.. then we will quickly look for 
the below alt coins to follow and trade them in the direction ethereum went. 

altcoins - ADAUSD, DOTUSD, MANAUSD, XRPUSD, UNIUSD, SOLUSD

look to see which one is lagging behind ethereum the most and make the trade on that one. 

we will have a stop loss (.2%) and take profit close (.25%) as variables so we can tweak

example - ethereum makes an up move breaking past the ATR.. or breaking through 
resistanceâ€¦ we look at the above altcoins to see which one is lagging the most and 
hasnt made the full move ETH has.. then we buy at the current bid. and sell with the 
conditions above.
